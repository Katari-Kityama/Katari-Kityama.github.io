          <p class="text">I love to try lots of computer hardware, which is reflected in my laptop purchases this year. I've owned 3 different gaming laptops since 12th grade started with each one of them being a different size and containing different hardware.</p>
          <p class="text">The laptop I started the year with was a 17.3in 2018 ROG gaming laptop with an i7-8750H Intel CPU and a RTX 2070 GPU. It's battery lasted only an hour and I sold it for 550. &#8594</p>

          <p class="text">This is a 2022 Zephyrus M16. I bought it for 550 and sold it for 725. It's a 16in laptop with a 12700H Intel CPU and an RTX 3060 GPU. Its battery lasted 5 to 8 hours depending on how it was used. &#8594</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Buying and selling laptops has provided me value through gaining an understanding of laptop markets, or in other words how to get a good deal. It's also greatly expanded my 'feel' for different hardware.</p>
