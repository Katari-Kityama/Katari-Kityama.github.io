          <p class="text">I invested a lot of time into 3D work this year for the purpose of learning some different software ecosystems as well as making VRChat avatars. I made my own avatar from scratch and edited several bases this year, and I also took a commission for a hoodie from someone on the internet.</p>
          <p class="text">On the right is a screenshot of the 3D model I made from scratch during the first few hours of the project. I started by drawing the character from the front and from the side before placing each polygon face by hand in relation to the drawings.</p>

          <p class="text">I took a 70 USD commission for a hoodie just before Christmas. I hadn't tried to make clothes yet, so it was a challenge to figure out the process. It ended up turning out really well and the person who payed me for it really liked it. You can see the Avali avatar wearing it in the screenshot.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Editing bases is much easier than creating a mesh from nothing. You don't need to use blender, and most of the work is creating textures in adobe substance painter and configuring the avatar in unity. I setup 2 avatars entirely this year with the nardoragon (bottom right) being near the start of the year and the novabeast (below) near the end of the year.</p>
