          <p class="text">I very recently bought this terrible Toshiba laptop for 50 dollars to use in place of the last laptop I sold.</p>
          <p class="text">I thought it would be interesting to use something as old as it as a daily driver and it provided an interesting challenge as I needed to make the most of the weak hardware. I addressed this issue by installing Linux Mint, which is much lighter and easier to run than Windows.</p>
